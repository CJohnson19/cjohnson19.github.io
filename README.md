# My Personal Website

This website is made using [Org Mode](https://orgmode.org/) and exporting it to
HTML. Because of this, forking this repo won't be very beneficial to anyone
unless they also have the HTML exporting configuration of my 
[Emacs config](https://github.com/CJohnson19/emacs-config/blob/main/config.org#exporting-to-html).
